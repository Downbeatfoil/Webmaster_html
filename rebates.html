        <h2>What is a tax credit?</h2>
        <p>A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of income tax you would otherwise owe. For example, claiming a $1,000 federal tax credit reduces your federal income taxes due by $1,000. The federal tax credit is sometimes referred to as an Investment Tax Credit, or ITC, though is different from the ITC offered to businesses that own solar systems.</p>

            <h2>What Is the Federal Green Energy Tax Credit?</h2>
            <p>
                Installing green energy solutions earns you a federal tax credit. That means you’ll get a credit for your income taxes that actually lowers your tax bill.
            </p>
            <br>
        
            <p>
                The federal government enacted the green energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC) in 2006. In the years since, the U.S. green energy industry has grown by more than 10,000% with an average annual growth of 50% over the last 10 years. The industry has created hundreds of thousands of jobs and invested billions of dollars in the U.S. economy.
            </p>
            <br>
        
            <p>
                You can qualify for the ITC for the tax year that you installed your green energy solutions as long as the system generates electricity for a home in the United States.
            </p>
            <h2>How Does the Federal Green Energy Tax Credit Work?</h2>
            <br>
        
            <p>
                When you purchase a green energy system during the tax year, you are eligible for a Federal Green Energy Tax Credit that you can claim on your federal income taxes for a percentage of the cost of the system.
            </p>
            <br>
        
            <p>
                In 2021, the ITC provided a 26% tax credit for systems installed between 2020 through 2022. The ITC will now provide 30% for systems installed in tax years 2022 through 2032. So, when deciding whether to install green energy solutions, factor in a 26% to 30% discount.
            </p>
            <br>
        
            <p>
                It’s essential to note that you can only claim the credit once. If the taxes you owe that year are less than the credit you earned, your credit will roll over to the following year. Also, remember that the credit is a deduction, not a refund.
            </p>
            <h3>Green Energy Tax Credit Extension</h3>
            <p>
                The Green Energy Investment Tax Credit has offered tax reduction incentives for homeowners who choose to “go green.” On August 16, 2022, embracing residential green energy became even more enticing when the Federal Government signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law.
            </p>
            <br>
        
            <p>
                Among numerous climate-conscious consumer and industry incentives, the most impactful is the increase, expansion, and extension of the Residential Clean Energy Credit—also known as the Green Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC).
            </p>
            <br>
        
            <p>
                The ITC effectively raises the amount of credit you can apply against your income tax burden from 26% to 30%. Instead of decreasing next year as scheduled, it’s been extended until 2032 before it reduces again. The tax credit is also retroactive to green energy systems installed during the 2022 tax year. Here’s what you need to know about the ITC and how to make it work for you.
            </p>
            <h4>The Inflation Reduction Act Green Energy Tax Credit Step-Down Schedule</h4>
            <p>
                Although the ITC will be around for at least the next decade, it will begin to phase out in 2033. At that time, the credit amount steps down to 26%. In 2034, it will be further reduced to 22% and eliminated for the tax year 2035.

            <h2>What Does the Federal Green Energy Tax Credit Cover?</h2>
            <br>
        
            <p>
                If you are a homeowner that recently installed a green energy system in 2022, you are eligible to claim a federal tax credit that covers 30% of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Green energy system cost</li>
                <li>Green energy equipment costs like inverters, wiring, and mounting hardware</li>
                <li>Labor costs for green energy system installation, including fees related to permitting and inspections</li>
                <li>Green power storage equipment costs like green energy batteries. Storage devices must have a capacity rating of at least 3 kilowatt-hours (kWh).</li>
                <li>Sales taxes paid for eligible green energy installation expenses (though some states waive sales tax on PV system equipment)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        
            <strong>Federal Green Energy Tax Credit Eligibility:</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
        
            <p>
                You can qualify for the ITC as long as your green energy system is new or being used for the first time between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2023. Unless Congress renews the ITC, it expires in 2024.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h3 class="center"> Other requirements include:</h3>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must own the system outright (not lease it)</li>
                <li>The system must be located in the United States</li>
                <li>The system must be located at your primary or secondary U.S. residence or for an off-site community green energy project</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Green Energy System Eligibility</h3>
            <p>
                To be eligible for the Federal Green Energy Tax Credit, you must install a green energy system that provides electricity for a residence, such as solar water heater or Fuel cells that rely on a renewable resource. Since solar water heaters use the sun’s thermal energy to heat water and Wind turbines generate up to 100 kilowatts of electricity for residential use, both systems will qualify for the Federal Green Energy Tax Credit.
            </p>
            <h2>Solar Panels (Photovoltaics)</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Solar panels, also known as photovoltaics, are devices that convert sunlight into electricity. They are a popular and clean source of renewable energy.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Solar-Powered Water Heaters</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Solar-powered water heaters use the sun's energy to heat water for use inside homes. They are an efficient and eco-friendly way to reduce energy bills.</p>

            <h2>Wind Turbines</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Wind turbines are structures that harness the power of wind to generate electricity for residential use. They are a sustainable source of clean energy.</p>
            <h2>Geothermal Heat Pumps</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Geothermal heat pumps utilize the Earth's stable temperature to provide heating and cooling for homes while minimizing energy consumption.</p>

            <h2>Fuel Cells</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Fuel cells generate power for homes using renewable resources, typically hydrogen. They are a reliable and efficient source of clean energy.</p>

            <h2>Battery Storage Technologies</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Battery storage technologies store excess energy for later use, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of renewable energy systems.</p>

<strong>Other requirements include:</strong>
<br>

<ul>
    <li>You must own the system outright (not lease it)</li>
    <li>The system must be located in the United States</li>
    <li>The system must be located at your primary or secondary U.S. residence or for an off-site community green energy project</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Claim Green Energy Tax Credit</h3>
<p>
    Following your green power installation, you can only claim the tax credit once. Therefore, you should speak to your green provider to supply the proper documentation and instructions, which include the following:
</p>
<br>

<ol>
    <li>File IRS Form 5695 as part of your tax return</li>
    <br>

    <li>In Part I, calculate the credit of the tax form</li>
    <br>

    <li>File your green system as “qualified green electric property costs”</li>
    <br>

    <li>On line 1, enter your project’s total costs as written in your green contract</li>
    <br>

    <li>On lines 6a and 6b, complete the calculations</li>
    <br>

    <li>On line 14, calculate any tax liability limitations using the IRS’s Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit Limit Worksheet</li>
    <br>

    <li>On lines 15 and 16, complete the calculations</li>
    <br>

    <li>On line 5, enter the exact figure from line 15 on your Schedule 3 (Form 1040)</li>
</ol>
<br>

<p class="center">
    You can also carry over any unused amount remaining on your tax credit that you could not claim in a single tax year.
</p>

<h3>When Should I Go Green?</h3>
<p>
    The new law is currently in effect and will be in some capacity until the end of 2034. From nearly every angle, going green now is more appealing than ever. So, is now the time to leap, or should you wait for an even better deal? The answer may not be as cut-and-dried as it appears. There are several factors to consider when deciding if a green PV system is worth it to you now, later, or never.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Green energy technology is better, less expensive, and more efficient than ever.</li>
    <li>Even with federal and state tax credits and utility company rebates, the average system still takes six to 10 years to pay for itself through lower energy costs.</li>
    <li>The tax credit reduces the amount of income tax you’ll owe. It’s not an immediate discount on products and installation. You’re still responsible for the upfront cost of the system.</li>
    <li>Several states offer some form of net metering that essentially pays you for creating more energy than you use with a PV system. These programs are being contested in some areas and may not last indefinitely.</li>
    <li>Other components of the same law offer incentives to industries and manufacturers of green and related products. The effect these incentives will have on overall pricing over the next several years is yet to be determined.</li>
    <li>Other green energy options, such as purchasing an interest in an off-site green project also include tax credit benefits and could be another choice beyond installing your own system.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Do Other Incentives Affect the Federal Green Energy Tax Credit?</h3>
<p>
    Green customers can take advantage of incentives to reduce the total installation costs of their system, from electric utility rebates and renewable electric certificates to state government rebates and state tax credits. These reductions will affect the amount you report to the IRS on your tax return.
</p>
<h4>State Green Energy Incentives</h4>
<p>
    Several states and Puerto Rico offer green incentives in addition to the federal ITC to encourage homeowners to install green. Each state has different incentives in place, but there are a few common ones: tax credits, rebates, and renewable energy certificates. States with a high number of green incentives include California, Texas, Minnesota, and New York.
</p>
<p>
    Each state has its own set of green incentives that vary significantly. Different agencies offer different green financial incentives, so talk to your installer and consult the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency for specifics.
</p>
<h4>State Tax Credits</h4>
<p>
    State tax credits work in the same way that the federal ITC does, but for your state taxes. Exact amounts vary significantly from state to state, and they generally don’t reduce your federal tax credits.
</p>
<h4>State Government Rebates</h4>
<p>
    Some states offer upfront rebates for installing a green power system. They are typically only available for a limited time while funds are available, so research rebates in your state to get in on the incentive before it runs out. A state government rebate can reduce your green costs by 10% to 20%.
</p>
<h4>Green Renewable Energy Certificate</h4>
<p>
    A Green Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC), sometimes referred to as a Green Renewable Energy Credit, is another type of state-level green incentive. After you install your green power system and register it with the appropriate state authorities, they will track your system’s energy production and periodically offer you SRECs as a benefit. You can sell your SREC to your local energy utility (or another buyer) to provide payment that’s typically considered taxable income.
</p>
<h4>Local Utility
    Rebates</h4>

    <p>
        Local utilities often provide some financial incentives to encourage local homeowners to install green power systems. Some offer rebates on energy bills based on how much energy the system produces, while others provide one-time subsidies to install a green power system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Incentives that pay you a per kilowatt-hour credit for the power that your system produces are known as PBIs, or performance-based incentives.
    </p>
    <h4>Subsidized Loans</h4>
    <p>
        Your state, local utility, or another non-government organization may offer subsidized loans to help you finance the purchase of your green panel system. Before you purchase your system, discuss options for subsidized loans with an installer in your area—they’re likely to know every green program available locally.
    </p>
    <h4>Tax Exemptions</h4>
    <p>
        In addition to tax credits, you may be eligible for certain tax exemptions after you install a green system. Despite the fact that these systems will increase your property value, some states and municipalities will not include them when assessing property taxes, which means your property tax bill will not go up with green installation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some states also have programs to ensure all purchases of green power system components are exempt from state sales taxes, which could save you hundreds of dollars when you go to install your system.
    </p>
    <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
    <p>
        Combining these various green tax credits and other financial incentives can save you money on your green power system installation. While installing one requires a significant amount of money upfront, these programs will greatly reduce the system’s overall cost.
