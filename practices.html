        <h2>1. Renewable Energy Sources</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Green energy relies on renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power. These sources produce clean electricity without depleting finite resources.</p>
    
        <h2>2. Energy Efficiency</h2>
        <br>

        <p>Improving energy efficiency in homes, businesses, and industries reduces energy waste. Practices include using energy-efficient appliances, better insulation, and LED lighting.</p>
    
        <h2>3. Sustainable Transportation</h2>
        <br>

        <p>Choosing eco-friendly transportation options like electric or hybrid vehicles, biking, or public transportation can significantly reduce carbon emissions.</p>
    
        <h2>4. Recycling and Waste Reduction</h2>
        <br>

        <p>Recycling materials and reducing waste minimizes the energy and resources required for production and disposal.</p>
    
        <h2>5. Conservation and Sustainable Practices</h2>
        <br>

        <p>Efforts to conserve water, protect natural habitats, and support eco-friendly agriculture contribute to green energy practices.</p>
    
        <h2>6. Government Incentives</h2>
        <p>Many governments offer incentives and subsidies for adopting green energy practices, making it more accessible and cost-effective for individuals and businesses.</p>
    
        <h2>7. Solar Power</h2>
        <br>

        <p>Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering energy bills for homeowners and businesses.</p>
    
        <h2>8. Wind Energy</h2>
        <br>

        <p>Wind turbines harness the power of the wind to generate electricity, providing a clean and renewable energy source.</p>
    
        <h2>9. Geothermal Energy</h2>
        
        <br>
        <p>Geothermal energy taps into heat from the Earth's core to provide heating, cooling, and electricity, with minimal environmental impact.</p>
        <br>

        <p>By adopting these practices, individuals and organizations can make a positive impact on the environment, reduce their carbon footprint, and promote a more sustainable future for all.</p>
